# AFrameProject
Authors: Angel Yang, Kacy Yeung, and Katherine McNeice 

This project utilizes A-Frame to create a 3D virtual reality representation of one of Josef Alber's geometric abstraction piece featured in his "from the Formulation : Articulation" portfolio (1972).

The 3D scene features basic elements present in the original artwork: 2 sets of geometric shapes combined together with contrasting colors focused in front of a blue background, a hollow, grey rectangular frame encasing the two geometric shapes, and two rectangular blue panes divided symmetrically across the frame-shape scene. 

For interactivity, the two colored strcutures at the center of the scene are animated. One set rotating in one direction, the other set rotating in the opposite under the same duration. The effect is the two structures coming back together in sync to represent the unified whole before the cycle repeats. The animation is controlled by a series of mouse events. Clicking on the animated object will force it to stop, and the animation will continue when hovered over again.
